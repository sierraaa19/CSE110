## Record (a) what worked or went well in MS 1, and (b) what didn't.  

### (a) What worked or went well
- Successful implementations of features such as addGoals, cross goals, prepending and appending, and the date.
- Great UI design 
- Great team communication, collaboration, and task division
### (b) What didn’t went well
- Missing app features:
  -  Initial message “You have no MSTs” upon opening the app
  -  Persistence, need to take the time at the point of creation and compare it with present time
- Testing
  -  Need to do more integration tests/ UI tests 
  -  More test/ mocking needed for each user story 
- GitHub improvement
  -  Should require issue number in all commit and pull requests
  -  Comprehensive code review is needed (no more Looks Good to Me!)

## Risks: adjusted, ranked, and classified high, medium, low, with a solution plan for each  
### Risk Analysis 1
- Risk: Team Member Unavailability
- Description: There is a risk that some team members may be unavailable attending meetings or working on tasks due to busy midterms and heavy workload in the last few weeks of the quarter, which may lead to miscommunication and impact the progress and the overall timeline of the project.
- Severity: High
- Resolution: We use Slack to communicate and share the most recent updates on the project to keep everyone on the same page and reasonably assign tasks to each iteration to ensure progress.   
- Status: Resolved

### Risk Analysis 2
- Risk: Missing app features from MS1
- Description: App lacks expected features, such as the initial message upon opening and time keeping. 
- Severity: High
- Resolution: Prioritize feature implementation in the backlog for MS 2. 
- Status: In progress

### Risk Analysis 3
- Risk: Inadequate testings
- Description: Integration tests and UI tests are insufficient and more testing is required for each user story.
- Severity: High
- Resolution: Allocate more time for testing in MS 2 and ensure adequate coverage for all user stories. 
- Status: In progress

### Risk Analysis 4
- Risk: GitHub action improvements
- Description: Github actions such as committing and opening pull requests did not include issue numbers and lack of comprehensive code review comments. 
- Severity: Medium
- Resolution: Enforce the requirement for issue numbers in all commits and pull requests and meaningful comments in code reviews. 
- Status: Resolved
 
## Calculation of Velocity with justification based on MS 1 results

We missed iteration 1 during MS1 so we divided iteration 2 into half.  

### Iteration 1:  

2/12 to 2/15: 4 days  
Estimate working hours: 28 hrs  
People:6  
Working hours per day: 2 hrs  
V1 = (Estimate working hour) / (Working Hour) = 28 hrs / (4 days * 6 people * 2 hrs/day) = 0.583  

### Iteration 2:  

2/16 to 2/18: 3 days  
Estimate working hours: 21 hrs  
People: 6  
Working hours per day: 2 hrs  
V2 = (Estimate working hour) / (Working Hour) = 21 hrs / (3 days * 6 people * 2 hrs/day) = 0.583  

### MS1 Velocity Result  

V total = 49 / (48+36) = 0.583  

### MS2 Planning  

Iteration 1 would be 3/3 - 3/8 (6 days)  
We estimated the overall task would require 38 hours, and considering that we have 6 people working together approximately 2 hrs/ day and there are 6 working days in iteration1, we get (6 days * 6 people * 2 hrs/day) = 72 hrs.   
38 hrs / 72 hrs = 0.5277  so we plan to perform approximately the same velocity as MS1.
