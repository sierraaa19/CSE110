## Successorator Group Project

### Project Overview  

Successorator is a mobile productivity application designed to help users effectively manage their daily goals and tasks. Unlike traditional to-do lists or calendar apps, Successorator prioritizes **success-driven task management**, ensuring that users stay focused on their Most Important Things (MITs) each day.  

This project is part of **Mobile Venture Capital’s (MVC) second-round competition**, where teams develop an assigned product to demonstrate their ability to **plan, design, implement, and deliver high-quality software**. The goal of Successorator is to provide a simple yet powerful tool that adapts to users’ dynamic schedules and helps them maintain productivity in their busy lives.

### Key Features  

- ✅ **Daily Success Lists** – Users set their top goals for the day, ensuring focus on high-priority tasks.  
- 🎤 **Voice Input** – Easily add tasks via voice recognition for quick, hands-free entry.  
- 🔄 **Task Completion & Rollover** – Completed tasks are marked off, while unfinished ones automatically roll over to the next day.  
- 🖌 **Minimalist Interface** – A clean and intuitive UI designed for efficiency.  
- ⏰ **Context-Aware Reminders** – Ensures users stay on track without overwhelming notifications.  

### Milestone 1 - Planning Phase  

The first phase of development focuses on defining the core functionalities and planning the software development process. Key deliverables for this milestone include:  

- 📌 **User Stories** – Defined using Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) to capture real-world scenarios.  
- ⚠️ **Risk Analysis** – Identifying potential challenges and mitigation strategies.  
- 🔄 **Iteration Planning** – Organizing development into sprints with clearly defined tasks.  
- ✅ **System Testing Plan** – End-to-end scenarios to validate the core user experience.  
- 📊 **GitHub Project Management** – Utilizing GitHub boards, pull requests, and CI/CD integration.  

### Development Methodology  

Successorator is being developed using **Head First Software Development principles**, with extensions for **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** and **end-to-end scenario testing**. Our workflow follows Agile methodologies, ensuring iterative improvements and adaptability throughout the project.
